                        world,
                        Batman has dedicated his
                        life to an endless crusade, a
                        war on all criminals in the name of his murdered parents, who were taken from him when he was
                        just a
                        child.
                        Since that tragic night, he has trained his body and mind to near physical perfection to be a
                        self-made
                        Super
                        Hero. He's developed an arsenal of technology that would put most armies to shame. And he's

                        teams

                <p id="fourth" class="robin">As bleak as Gotham City can seem, it’s always had at least one ray of
                    light—Robin. The Boy Wonder has long kept Batman from becoming TOO dark of a Dark Knight with his
                    optimism, energy and youthful exuberance. He’s the epitome of the young comic book sidekick—the one
                    by
                    which all others are measured. Robin celebrates his 75th Anniversary this year, something that was
                    commemorated at San Diego Comic-Con with the announcement of a new weekly series, a Robin-centered
                    crossover event and the unveiling of a new graphic that charted the history of the character over
                    his
                    (and sometimes her) 75 years.</p><br>
